# creating an alert rule
need to select scope like which resource we have to monitor.(what is the resource that is going to be affected)
we have to specify the condition(signal name) ---> on what basis we need to trigger the alert.
need to specify the action group(it will invoke actions and notifications when an alert is triggered).


metrics ---> they are numerical values they represent things like cpu usage in % , disk space remaining.
